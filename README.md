# HepsiburadaTestAutomation
I have created a test automation framework with using Selenium WebDriver + Maven Java + TestNG + Page Object design pattern with using Pace Factory. 
Testcases: 
Login hepsiburada.com,
Add a product to the cart,
Go to 'my cart' page

First of all, for each and every page I have created java class seperately. 
I used util package for all the common methods and variables
I read global properties like username, password, browser etc. from "config.properties" file
